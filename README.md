Hi, I'm Luis Aguilar, a mechatronics engineering student and systems technician. 
I'm currently learning Python and MATLAB to expand my programming knowledge since I have the basics in these programming languages but not an advanced level. 
I'm looking to share some of the projects I've done with my current level in different languages.
You can contact me at my email address: quirozaguilarluis@gmail.com
